    //1. determine a bounding box that contains all segments of S and initialize the trapezoidal map structure T and search structure D for it
    //2. compute a random permutation of the elements of S
    //3. for i = 1 to n
    //4. do find the set of trapezoids in T properly intersected by Si
    //5. remove trapezoids from T and replace them by the new trapezoids that appear because of the insertion of Si
    //6. remove the leaves for the trapezoids from D and create leaves for the new trapezoids. Link the new leaves to the existing inner nodes by adding some new inner nodes.
